Hello! This is about us, Ramneek Narayan ("Ed Elric"), Dingting Shen ("Al Elric"), Mei Chang, and Izumi Curtis; the instructors for Alchemy107. We are eager to see you guys doing alchemy, thinking about the problems, and developing yourselves spiritually. All of us have our PhDs in Alchemy and in differing concentrations too. For Ramneek, he specializes in mathematical alchemy and is strong with chakra 19, the clockwork chakra. For Dingting, he specializes in tara alchemy and is strong with chakra 17, the grounding chakra. Mei specializes in medicinal alchemy and is strong with chakra 107, the universal chakra. Izumi specializes in leviathan alchemy and is strong with chakra 23, the sequential chakra.

We are ready to do alchemy with all of the lightning and special effects as the entire universe is under the catacomb setting!
