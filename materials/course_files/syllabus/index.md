Hello and welcome to alchemy for the modern day (alchemy107)! We think you'll have a great time investigating old alchemy problems and learning more about what it means to be a being here.

## What will we do?

The course covers just about everything in alchemy but has been adapted for the modern day. So, what this means is that, we have taken most of the rigor and heavy thinking behind the processes out. All four of us have taken input from you guys here in the modern world and have trimmed down what is required for basic alchemy. We know how hard it can be to do alchemy in a modern day setting and hence we came up with this course. We will go into...

1. catacomb alchemy
2. great fairy alchemy
3. natural alchemy
4. quantum alchemy
5. spiritual alchemy
6. etc...

> We will go over how to make a real philosopher stone! We hope you guys can also make them as well and will give the Magnum Opus to study. This means that everyone will have an end to disease, gold, silver, platinum, and live long! Yes!

**P.S:** *grades get in the way of true learning and we don't really know what makes a person smart. But, a good grade is a mark of diligence, something you'll need later in life frequently. (I sure did!). So earn a good grade, but have it out of your head until finals are over. Know where you need to improve first. Past that, it won't really matter; what you actually did during this time will! Don ªt worry about your grade, just focus on the alchemy...*

Time and dates, we'll tell you guys later (2 weeks in advance). *If you have any problems with the dates, grading, and need adjustments. Just come up and ask or email us. We will work something out. Life happens, we get it.*

## Where is the University?

You can find the university at **1085 Skyway CT. Turlock, CA 95380; USA.** This is our "home" and where we will be doing the teaching/labs/tests/grading. If you want to email us you can use our main line at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">ramneeknarayan@gmail.com</a>.

But don't worry to much about them right now so much as actually understanding what you read. If it gets in the way of critical thinking, best discard it. The main reason you came was to think critically about alchemy. Relax and enjoy thinking! Wishing you well this term and life in general...
